Wake up the very next day and make sure to read your task and make them happen! \n\nIf You feel like this task its not your priority for today, go ahead and move them to your extra tasks! \n\nOnce you read that task, go ahaed and delete it. And start adding your own great tasks 💪🏽"

    static let SecondariesBody = "Hi again! \nHere you can keep your extra tasks. Those that you consider important but not essential.\n\n If you want to become a highly effective person, make sure to always finish your Priorities before Extras.\n\nGood Luck 👊🏽"
