# TaskOrganiserApp

Task Organiser App is my first project. It allows users to save and edit created tasks. Users can put tasks to either the "Priorities" bucket or "Secondaries". Users can freely migrate them between buckets.
Technology used:
- UIKit
- User Defaults as Persistence Manager
- User Defaults for first time running app message
- Collection Views 
- Diffable Data Source
- Compositional Layouts
- UI adjustment to screen sizes (including iPhone SE 1st gen. and iPhone 8 Zoomed)
- Night/Light mode UI adjustment

Please follow the link below to watch the short video presenting the functionality of the app:)
